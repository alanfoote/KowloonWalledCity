		<p>The band known as Kowloon Walled City was formed in 2007, with an aim of being "heavy, but not metal" and has a sound that has been described as existing <i>“between the apocalyptic melancholy of Neurosis and the grief of everyday life of Codeine or Bedhead”</i> (Rock-A-Rolla Magazine, 2015). Over the past 14 years they have released four full length albums, all of which they have recorded and produced themselves. </p>

    <p> The band has no real connection to the lost city, but their sound and aesthetic are in keeping with the atmosphere of the dark enclave. While the city was tightly knit together with life that could be ambitious, discordant, and forgiving, held together with ramshackle and impromptu structures, the bands music creates space out of the gritty elements of music, using lyrical imagery that pays tribute to the struggles of labor, the consequences of unchecked capitalism, and the weight of misfortune.</p><p> The video  for their song "Piecework" (featured below) slowly walks us through an abandoned home, once built to house a family but now disintegrating at the seams from years of neglect. Both 'Kowloons' speak to the struggle of existence, even though one in an art form and one was a reality. </p>
