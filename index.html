		<p>Many people do not know of the original Kowloon Walled City,<br> as it existed for decades on the periphery of Hong Kong,<br> and was demolished in the early 1990's.</p>
		<p>Many people also may not know of the other Kowloon Walled City either,<br> a post-metal band based out of the Bay Area. </p>
			<p> This website attempts to connect the two disparate ideas, <br> as one (the band) appears to be heavily influenced by the other (the enclave). </p>
